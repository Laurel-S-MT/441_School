 <h1>Video Game Memory</h1>

 <p>When I was little, my older sister discovered a game; Sonic Adventure 2. I began to watch her play the game and enjoy Sonic,
  Mainly because he was blue, my favorite color. I soon got hooked into the game and its franchise. Everytime I would play the first level
  where Sonic was escaping the police, I would always ask my sister for help at the end of the level. A big semi truck would jump out and chase you
  and it always scared me. I'm sure it annoyed my sister a bit whenever I would ask for help but she'd do it everytime to which I'm thankful for.
