<p class="blog-para">
 When I was little, my older sister discovered the game Sonic Adventure 2, I constidly watched her play the game and got hooked into the world of Sonic because he was my favorite color; Blue. 
 Whenever I would play the first stage of the hero side (when Sonic is escaping from the police) I would always ask my sister to help with the end of the level that involved a scary giant semi truck chasing after you. 
 I'm pretty sure my sister was annoyed with me asking everytime.
