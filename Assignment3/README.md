 I used chat gpt to try and create the homework assignment. It looks well made at first glance, but I keep running into problems in starting the game. The first attempt had no buttons to click to start, gpt said like "there is no buttons to start; you begin by doing this..." and that didnt work either. I asked for it to add buttons and fix the problems that followed multiple times but none of the codes worked.

 I tried a 2nd time, Same problem; looks well made, theres buttons this time, but the buttons are still not working-I even fixed a keyword that was undefined before. Still no luck. I gave up. I was honestly bummed about not seeing how it'd go, seeing how it looks better looking than my own work...at least its functional.

 Good lesson on why we shouldnt primarily depend on AI for homework :P
