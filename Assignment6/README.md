For this week, AI's version isnt too different from what I can guess as it didnt provide any picures; I guess expecting me to choose the picture on my own. From the web developer tools it seems to act functional when I do click on a box where an image should be in. Only providing the error about the images.
While working on my own project, gpt was really into suggesting to use the function of "shuffling" and seems to have implemented it into their own. I didnt use it in my own as the images shuffle after refresh.
