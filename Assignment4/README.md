Chat gpt example: Diffrent way of formatting than from the lesson but seems a bit more confusing to me. Creating the hw with gpt was easier and functional than last lesson. Only downside of it is the pictures not loading in. Short and simple story like mine. Not too bad, kinda cute. Also kinda wonder if it took my "treasure" idea probably not but I submitted my codes so many times to figure out problems.

fyi I used chat gpt in some parts of my own HW for help-it was a struggle-but a reminder that AI can be a helpful tool in seeing whats wrong with the code when web developer tools fall short. I had to redo it because the coding and choices was overwelming and hard to keep track of. Thats why there are now just the choices of "wild flowers and ribbons" no more shiny things.
