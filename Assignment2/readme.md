 What I created was using the activity practice as reference and start for the page with a light blue background and a pop up prompt.

 I wasnt sure how to ask AI to make the page so I used the activity practice prompts that were provided there. I assume thats what they were there for. There is a html file provided of what it made along with a console log. Its entirely different and a lot more simpler than mine; full black screen with the word "HI" in bright green.

 As much as I dont really like to code; I dont like using AI more. However, I understand it can be a helpful tool when it comes to coding, but relying on it can take away the learning aspect and enjoyment of it if you let it do the work for you. If I only relied on it to do that-it wouldnt sit right for me.

 The AI work doesnt feel like my own. I only edited the console log message.
